### **Introduction to the Diamonds Dataset**

The diamonds dataset is a comprehensive collection of data related to the characteristics and prices of diamonds. It is widely used in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling to understand the factors that influence diamond pricing and to develop predictive models. This dataset is highly regarded in both academic and industry contexts due to its detailed and structured nature, making it an excellent resource for various analytical tasks.

### **Overview of the Dataset**

The dataset includes a total of 53,940 observations of diamonds with several key attributes that describe each diamond's physical characteristics and price. The dataset provides a rich source of information for exploring the relationships between these characteristics and the market price of diamonds.


### **Key Points:**

Outlier Adjustment: Uses the IQR method with modified multiplier values.
Data Labeling: Replaces categorical values with numerical ones based on a dictionary.
Missing Values: Fills missing values with the mean of the columns.
Feature Engineering: Creates new features based on existing ones.
Model Training: Uses GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for the XGBRegressor.
This refined version should work as expected. Make sure that the diamonds DataFrame is correctly loaded at the beginning of the script.


### **Key Features**

Price: The price of the diamond in US dollars, which serves as the target variable for predictive modeling.
Carat: The weight of the diamond, measured in carats. It is a crucial factor in determining the price.
Cut: The quality of the diamond cut, categorized into 'Fair', 'Good', 'Very Good', 'Premium', and 'Ideal'. The cut affects the diamond's brilliance and overall appearance.
Color: The color grading of the diamond, ranging from 'D' (colorless) to 'J' (light color). Less color generally increases the value of a diamond.
Clarity: The clarity grading, which measures the presence of inclusions or blemishes. The scale includes 'I1', 'SI1', 'SI2', 'VS1', 'VS2', 'VVS1', 'VVS2', and 'IF'.
Depth: The total depth percentage of the diamond, which is the height of the diamond divided by the average diameter.
Table: The width of the diamond's top flat surface (table) as a percentage of its average diameter.
x, y, z: The length, width, and depth of the diamond in millimeters, providing a 3-dimensional measure of the diamond's size.This project aims to analyze a travel booking company, focusing on profit analysis and the various factors that affect their attainment.Using Power BI to design graphical analysis that allows for useful insights for different areas.  


### **Diamond Price Prediction using XGBoost**

This project utilizes the XGBoost algorithm to predict diamond prices using features such as cut, color, clarity, carat weight, and physical dimensions. The goal is to train a model that can accurately predict the price of a diamond based on these features.

### **Repository Contents**

diamonds.csv: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
diamonds_price_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and prediction evaluation.
README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.

### **Dependencies**

The code is written in Python 3 and requires the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
xgboost
These dependencies can be installed via pip:

Copiar c√≥digo
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost


### **Usage**

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the diamonds_price_prediction.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
Execute the cells in the Notebook in order to load the data, perform data cleaning, feature engineering, train the model, and evaluate the predictions.
You can adjust the parameters of the XGBoost model and the GridSearchCV configuration according to your needs.
Once you are satisfied with the trained model, you can use it to make predictions on new diamond data.
